<h1>Alexandra and David are getting married!</h1>

<p>This is the moment when David should have proposed. He instead took a series of not so good photos. Later that day he did propose, and there was a photographer there that took better photos. This site is a placeholder for when the photographer sends us the better photos.</p>
